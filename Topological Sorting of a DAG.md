# Ex. No: 17D - Topological Sorting of a DAG

## AIM:
To write a Python program to **print topological sorting** of a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Create a graph and add edges to represent relationships between nodes.

**Step 2**: Use a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes and a **stack** (or list) to record the **order of nodes** after processing.

**Step 3**: Perform **DFS** for each unvisited node:
- Explore all its neighbors.
- Recursively apply DFS to each unvisited adjacent node.
- After all neighbors are visited, **push the current node onto the stack**.

**Step 4**: After DFS is complete for all nodes, the stack will contain nodes in **reverse order of their completion time**.

**Step 5**: Print the stack in **reverse** to get the **topological order**.
